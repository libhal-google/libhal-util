/**
 * @brief Use this to perform changes on an object its move constructor is
 * executed.
 *
 * This can be used to allow type T to use a default move constructor but allow
 * specific operations to occur beforehand. This is used for moveable objects
 * with callbacks that refer back to their object's address such as the
 * following:
 *
 *     this->obj->set_callback([this]() { foo(); });
 *
 * The default move constructor does everything correctly for type T. But the
 * address of "this" in the lambda expression refers to the previous object's
 * address which is no longer valid. Rather than a make a whole move constructor
 * just to update this one callback, the move_interceptor can be used to change
 * the previous object's callback to the new object's address before the move
 * occurs. Then the object's default move constructor is executed.
